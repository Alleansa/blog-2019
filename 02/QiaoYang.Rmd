Write a blog post addressing the questions: 

1. **Which (base R) functions do you know that support the split-apply-combine strategy? In your opinion, are these sufficient - state why or why not?**.

    `split`, `*apply`, `aggregate`. Not sufficient, because they are non-readable and have non-consistent usage.

2. **Using a dataset of your choice, show (by including the split-apply-combine command(s) in your answer) how you can use the split-apply-combine strategy for a part of the data analysis.**

    Calculate the sample mean for each species from the data `iris`.
    ```{r}
    aggregate(iris[, -5], list(Species = iris$Species), mean)
    ```
