1. **Which (base R) functions do you know that support the split-apply-combine strategy? In your opinion, are these sufficient - state why or why not?**. 

There are some R function that can support the split-apply-combine strategy,such as "split()", "apply()", "tapply()", 
"aggregate()" etc.


2. **Using a dataset of your choice, show (by including the split-apply-combine command(s) in your answer) how you can use the split-apply-combine strategy for a part of the data analysis.**

I accessed a built-in dataset that calls chickwts. 
```{r}
attach(chickwts)
wm <- tapply(weight, feed,  mean) 
wsd <- tapply(weight,  feed, sd)
```

If using the `plyr` package,
```{r}
library(tidyverse); library(plyr);

ddply(chickwts, .(feed), summarise, mean = mean(weight), sd = sd(weight))
```
