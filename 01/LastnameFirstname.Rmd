Write a blog post answering the following questions: 

1. **Looking back at all of the team projects you have been involved in, describe the biggest mishap you had. Could that have been avoided using git? How?**. 

2. **Give an example of one new git feature that you learned about from Jenny Bryan's book.**.

## Instructions:

Update your forked 'blog-2019' repository.

Save a **copy** of this file, replacing "Lastname" and "Firstname" with your own and *leave the original unedited*.

In **your copy**, replace the `title:` and `author:` fields in the YAML above, while leaving the remaining fields intact. Remove the background and the instructions sections and write your blog post! 

Once you are done, **create a pull request** to upload your changes to the original repository. Do not commit the compiled HTML file to the repository.
