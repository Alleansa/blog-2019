## Describe what intervals, durations, periods, and instants are, and give one example for each that shows why we need these distinctions.

*Instants* represent a point in time. On the other hand,  *Intervals* represent a span of time with a specific beginning instant and a specific end instant. *Durations* refer to length of time recorded in seconds. *Periods* refer to a span of time in a unit larger than a second. Periods are not of a consistent length since periods such as months and years are not of a consistent length.


## The `ggplot2` package works seamlessy with lubridate. Find a data set with dates and/or times, use lubridate to work with the dates/times, then plot a time-related aspect of the data and describe it.
