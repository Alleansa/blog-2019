1. **Under what license does R operate?**

    	 GNU GPL v2
       
       Definition from (Wikipedia)[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_General_Public_License#Version_2] :
       
       "The GNU General Public License (GNU GPL or GPL) is a widely used free software license, which guarantees end users the freedom 
        to run, study, share and modify the software." 

2. **Answer the three questions listed above for the licenses: MIT, GPL-3,  LGPL-3, and CC-0. Note that some of the questions might not be answered with a simple yes/no. In that case, go into more detail, but do not just copy the terms of the license.**
   
    1. Are you and your collaborators fine with other people modifying your work and then sharing the modified work?

    2. Are you and your collaborators fine with other people making a profit from those derivations?

    3. Who is responsible if your software does not do what it promises to do?

3. **Assume that you are in the process of making a package for your own graduate work. Describe considerations that come into play in deciding on a license. In case you are not quite at that stage in your graduate studies yet, come up with a likely scenario. Describe it and discuss.**
