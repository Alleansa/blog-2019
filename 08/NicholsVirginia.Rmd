## Background:

Image files come in all kinds of formats. There's png, tiff, svg, pdf, just to name a few. What's the difference, and how can we work with them?

Reading: 

  - Identify online sources to read up on differences between image file formats. 

  - The `magick` package allows us to work with raster images in R. Read through the  [magick vignette](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/magick/vignettes/intro.html) to learn about the package's functionality.

Write a blog post answering the following questions and detailing the progress: 

1. **Describe the difference between formats png, svg, and pdf. State your sources with (working!) links (take a look at the RMarkdown cheatsheet for RStudio to learn how to make working links). Make one plot in ggplot2 and save it (using R code) in each of the three file formats you discussed. Comment on the differences you observe in their usage.**

I had a hard time finding a site that covered these 3 files types, so I cobbled together a comparison via a conglomeration of ![this](https://blog.mrdaniels.ch/warz/png-vs-svg-2017/) and ![that](https://blog.hubspot.com/insiders/different-types-of-image-files). 

The differences seem to depend on your goal in life. If you are photographer, versus a graphic designer, versus a web-developer...your opinion is shaped by your background. 

A helpful 'high-level' distinction is raster (jpeg, gif, png) versus vector (pdf). Don't resize rasters - make them the size you will ultimately use. png = good for web. svg = outdated.  
png and svg both offer transparent backgrounds, pdf does not. png is better than svg. 

I made a figure in all three (png, pdf, svg) formats. 
```{r, echo = F}
library(tidyverse)
library(svglite)

mtcars %>%
  ggplot(aes(wt, mpg)) + 
  geom_point(aes(size = hp, fill = hp), pch = 21)

#ggsave("myfig.png")
#ggsave("myfig.pdf")
#ggsave("myfig.svg")

#ggsave("myfig2.png", height = 3, width = 3)
#ggsave("myfig2.pdf", height = 3, width = 3)


```

svg required the installation of the svglite package AND it took *FOREVER*. Plus, I couldn't view it. 

I tried each png and pdf at 7x7" and 3x3" to see if the size made a difference. It didn't. I think the pdf looked a little sharper. 


2. **Use `magick` functionality to create an image to be used for a hex sticker.**  package `hexSticker` can help you to get started on dimensions of the sticker. **Include all code necessary to produce your sticker.** In case you are using local images, post those in a folder on **your** website and use the URL to link to them.

## Instructions:

Update your forked version of the 'blog-2019' repository (or re-fork it after deleting your previous repo).

Save a **copy** of this file, replacing "Lastname" and "Firstname" with your own and *leave the original unedited*. (Note: Lastname = your family name, Firstname = your given name)

In **your copy**, replace the `title:` and `author:` fields in the YAML above, while leaving the remaining fields intact. Remove the background and the instructions sections and write your blog post! 

Once you are done, **create a pull request** to upload your changes to the original repository. Do not commit the compiled HTML file to the repository.
