## Problems encountered

I chose `rmardown` to construct a static website. I don't have any issues when I went throught the exmaple in [R Markdown: The Definitive Guide](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/rmarkdown-site.html) I am able to to the following:

* create a navigation bar from both left and right.
* hyperlink (i.e. link to the repo)
* duplicate Rmd partials 
* Add new Rmd files to add new pages

I am going to use this website to combine all my study notes, so that I can nagviate them during any project, or sharing material to other people.
