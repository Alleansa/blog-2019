## The website

https://vanichols.github.io/

## Reflection/Challenges

I used Rmarkdown website because I'm new at this, and no need to be a masochist. 

I had a fun time making my website. It could be a time suck, because it is more fun than editing draft 13 of my roots paper. Self discipline is always tested in this world of R....

For some reason the website accessed through that link doesn't look like the one I see when I open it from RSTudio. The theme doesn't carry through, I think?
